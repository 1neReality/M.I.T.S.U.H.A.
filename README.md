# OneReality
A virtual waifu that you can speak to through your mic and it'll speak back to you!

# How it works
First, the Python package SpeechRecognition recognizes what you say into your mic, then that speech is written into an audio (.wav) file, which is sent to OpenAI's Whisper speech to text transcription AI, and the transcribed result is printed in the terminal and sent to OpenAI's GPT-3, then GPT's response will be printed in the terminal and translated to Japanese, which will also be printed in the terminal, and finally, the Japanese translation will be sent to the VoiceVox text to speech engine and will be read out in an anime girl-like voice (It sounds like Megumin from Konosuba). All of this happens in approximately 7-11 seconds, depending on the length of what you say, the length of what the AI says, and your GPU (slightly).
